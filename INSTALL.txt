=====================================

This document describes how to set up a NetWeather server. There are a significant number of
components necessary so the installation isn't trivial. At some point this software should be
packaged in a way that makes the installation process easier.

Currently the assumption is that all the necessary tools and libraries to actually build the
system will be installed on the running NetWeather server. This is convenient in some ways; it
allows a developer the option of making last minute changes to the system in situ. It also
allows the operator to easily apply bug fixes by simply updating a working copy of the source
and recompiling as needed.

Required Third Party Components
-------------------------------

+ TortoiseSVN

This is needed to check out the source code. Also if any changes to the source prove necessary,
TortoiseSVN can be used to commit those changes back to the repository.

+ GNAT GPL 2008

Technically the Ada compiler is not needed for running NetWeather. However, it may prove useful
to have it available in case some last minute tweaks to the code are necessary (as described
above).

+ GtkAda (tested with v2.10.0)

This component is required for the user interface. Install it in the "usual" location and be
sure C:\GtkAda\bin is in the path (for access to the DLLs). Really only the DLLs are needed at
run time, but it is easiest to just install the entire package. Unfortunately the GtkAda
installer will want to build the libraries, thus requiring the Ada compiler as a prerequisite.

+ Win32Ada

This component is needed for operating system level access to the serial port. It should be
installed in the default location. No special post-installation steps are needed.

+ PostgreSQL

The database server needs to be installed in the default way. Create the necessary tables
manually [provide details here]. NetWeather assumes the user 'postgres' with password
'frenchfry.'

+ APQ

The APQ database access library needs to be installed. The DLLs need to be copied to a folder in
the path.

+ AWS

The compiled AWS binaries need to be installed with the DLLs copied to a folder in the path. The
ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment variable needs to be set to point at the aws.gpr file.

Hardware
--------

Connect the hardware to COM1 on the NetWeather server. This is necessary; currently NetWeather
does not provide a way to configure which serial port it uses. Review the contents of the
Config.txt file in the NetWeather build folder. Specifically adjust the value of the calibration
settings as appropriate.

Operation
---------

Compile and run the NetWeather server; enable the hardware in the console interface. Manual
queries can be conducted against the database to view the data being entered into the system.
Point a web browser at the NetWeather server (port 80) to view the web interface to the system.
