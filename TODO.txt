+ The Database package does not yet implement the Get_First_Date and Get_Last_Date functions.
These functions are needed for the mock data test program. Implementing them will require
constructing an appropriate SQL query and executing it.

+ Get the database set up properly. NetWeather currently requires the tables to be created
before the program runs. Probably the precise steps necessary (SQL statements) should be
recorded somewhere.

+ The web interface is mostly incomplete. This is the last major component of the program that
needs building.
