NetWeather
==========

NetWeather is a network accessible weather station. It was used as a class project during the
Spring 2008 semester of ELT-2720 and CIS-2720. A team of students in Williston (under the
direction of Matt Gallagher) developed the weather station hardware and electronics. A team of
students in Randolph (under my direction) developed the server software. This repository
contains the result of those efforts.

It is my hope that NetWeather will continue to grow and develop. Many useful and interesting
extensions can be imagined. The project is, in general, a good example of the nature of
electrical and computer engineering technology as taught at Vermont Technical College. The
existing system could serve as a good starting point for future projects or even have a role as
a marketing and recruitment tool.
